# Follow-up Emailing Scheme (Midas)

1. **T+2 days (Follow-up 1: value bump)**
   - Short reminder and one concrete value proof.
2. **T+5 days (Follow-up 2: objection handling)**
   - Address likely friction (time, budget, risk) with low-friction next step.
3. **T+9 days (Follow-up 3: social proof + offer)**
   - Include concise case pattern and optional asset (one-pager/demo).
4. **T+14 days (Follow-up 4: breakup but open loop)**
   - Respectful close, ask permission to reconnect later.

## Guardrails

- Max 4 follow-ups over 14 days.
- Stop immediately for negative sentiment or unsubscribe signals.
- Randomize among approved high-score templates to reduce spam patterning.
- Respect sender mailbox daily/hourly quotas.
- Always include one-click unsubscribe and reason capture.

## Optimization Loop

- Track open/reply/positive-reply/booked-call by template variant and niche.
- Promote top quartile variants.
- Retire bottom 20% variants.
- Regenerate templates weekly with the quality-validation agent.
